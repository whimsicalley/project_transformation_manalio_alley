    * [Combining Google fonts](http://googlewebfonts.blogspot.com/2010/09/optimizing-use-of-google-font-api.html)

    I've combined Google fonts before, but wanted to make sure I was doing it properly.

    * [Visually hidden boiler plate code](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/css/main.css#L107-L169)

    I used this to hide headings, as we did in class. This allows my code to be structurally correct but still look good from a design standpoint.
