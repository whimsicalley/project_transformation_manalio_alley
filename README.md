## Resources

* [Combining Google fonts](http://googlewebfonts.blogspot.com/2010/09/optimizing-use-of-google-font-api.html)

    I've combined Google fonts before, but wanted to make sure I was doing it properly.

* [Visually hidden boiler plate code](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/css/main.css#L107-L169)

    I used this to hide headings, as we did in class. This allows my code to be structurally correct but still look good from a design standpoint.

* [Single vs multiple asides](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19333404/single-html-aside-or-multiple-asides)

    I used this article to find out if a site in general could have more than one aside. It helped me decide against changing all elements with the id of "sidebar" to simply the semantic "aside".

* [Banner content placement](https://www.sitepoint.com/community/t/html5-where-do-you-normally-place-the-banner-content-header-area-section-or/29045/6)

    This site helped me decide if I should put the banner within the header or not. The general consensus was to not put it in there!

## Comments

* I just want to say **thank you** for your thorough e-mail back to me regarding this project. It helped tremendously.
